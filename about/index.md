Manda Putra is Software Engineer (Web Development) without _degree_ to proof it. Help many companies to do software engineering and also became the part of it. His company right now call him Product Engineer, although he admit doesn't do well with front-end development.

He always interested in technical low level stuff, realtime apps, esoteric programming languages, and databases!. Probably the best way to describe his passion is with this motto "If you don't understand the beginning, you wont able to make a better future".

You may want to contact him via [email](mailto:mandaputra@gmail.com) if you had some problem with your software, or you need some companion to dip your toes on these complicated software stuff.

But before that lest talk about his runtime right now :

- Work at [ZeroOneGroup](https://zero-one-group.com/) as Product Engineer.
- Mantain Vue.js ID Group on [github](vuejs.id) and telegram.
- Tinkering with his idea of 10 Billion Dollars software that hadn't released yet.
- Made a book about programming, blogging about programming and daily life.

Thats it for now, I will update this page if necessary.

You may want to look his [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0HUed_PquAmJDqzSFCkIgMJwnE_Fvq4cu9MAstP-5Q/) for more _proofed_ reason.
