Hey i got tilde page you know it is cool take a look [here](https://tilde.club/~mandaputtra/). If you want to learn some Unix thing without your server, tilde is a cool service. It is free. More information on tilde, read [Paul Blog](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf). Bunch of Friendly Ambitious Nerd are on the server.

## Some software that I highly use

1. [Dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) SQL Database Management, NoSQL I use terminal tbh.
2. Bypass telkomsel and another shit provider stuff [nextdns](https://nextdns.io/).
3. Git UI, mostly I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to resolve some conflict, and Install [GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io/).
4. [cmus](https://github.com/cmus/cmus) and [tizonia](https://tizonia.org/) for music player.
5. [MailSpring](https://getmailspring.com/) for mail stuff, sometimes terminal wont work for email.

## Learn Programming

I believe programming isn't for everyone, but if you want to learn the stuff yourself, I got some nice resource (In English). TBH you better get used to english cause it will be used while you're programming, so no more "Wah pakai bahasa inggris ya gan, ga ada yang Indonesia".

1. [frecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) newb friendly, the forum here make me want to pursue code.
2. [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)
3. Test your skill, LeetCode, HackerRank, AdventOfCode, Triplebyte, and others. Some company use these as a measurement on interview. Better try it.
4. Official Documentation, sometimes you should read something on the docs.
5. Please be patient, coding is hard - take your time.

### Some Indonesian resource

Banyak yang saya suka di youtube, beberapa :

1. [Pemrogramman Web UNPAS](youtube.com/channel/UCkXmLjEr95LVtGuIm3l2dPg)
2. [Nusendra](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPs91pCgbgtcSdnczFSAkdA)
3. [Taman Kode Kode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmi_lq7fAUKht8EHpzLgVIg)

Literasi tentang pemmrogramman dengan bahasa Indonesia tidak terlalu banyak, jadi sering - seringlah sharing di internet, agar banyak :)

## Podcast

I love podcast, sometimes I just search on [dev.to podcast](https://dev.to/pod) section.

But here some list :

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/) podcast, Seriously it is a fun podcast.
- If Braddy Haran is there then it is my favourite show, like [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) and [Unmade Podcast](https://www.unmade.fm/)
- Everything Aaron Mahnke, [Lore](https://www.lorepodcast.com/), and others podcast he do.
- And all show on the [Changelog Podcast](https://changelog.com/)

And I think just that other random stuff maybe I'll, update again later.
