I'm starting to incorporate AI on my everyday job right now. Although most of them are trivial tasks. Like CRUD, parsing, etc. When you can just type what you want, and someone will do your job is a time safer indeed. But not all of my job consist of creating CRUD, sometimes you connect two things, optimizing somethings, research, etc.

Today I sit at a cafe and work, I look at my desk mate, he uses AI to generate their code. Fine, me too. But the one thing that make me laugh is he repeated the question until the AI get it right. And you know what? Its just trivial problem like centering things in CSS, bug like you forgot the `onClick` handler, etc.

> what a clown, why not learn it and you can fix it yourself

That's my inner voice. Obviously I don't want to start a fight with people that I just met. And I don't want young and aspiring software engineer to quit either.

AI need more context to progress and saying "Its still not center yet" on you prompt aren't gonna fix it in the first try. That wasting time. I hate it, why doing software development when you don't want to understand the pieces after pieces working together? I don't know every CSS rules. But at least I care, I know how some of them works, and I know how to fix some bugs.

This remind me of [Jonathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) talks, it's starting to collapse lol.

On one side, the experienced software developer are much more benefiting from AI. But other side, new programmers are clueless.

What a world. Hope he find this post
