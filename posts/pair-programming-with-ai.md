I do believe that AI is for the better of humanity, back then when ChatGPT was first released I didn't feel any threat. But still, I'm not using it since most of the time the code it generated doesn't fit my taste. And sometimes they use obsolete not working methods. But that problem aside, the big issue for me is that there are no good Neovim integrations.
But AI Code Companion is still a handy feature, I can make it generate code for boring tasks like translating XML to Type Script type system, creating a table for me, etc.

After Open AI announced that their newest AI version ChatGPT 4o is free for VSCode users, I decided to revisit again and, ooooh boy! Still not a threat but the way it codes it almost mimics me, and 80% of the time they suggest the correct answer (but not a good code lol ~).

I won't get into details, as far as I know, if you were using it, you should already know the flaws. For some new programming languages that trending like Rust, it still doesn't seem to suggest a better answer. But for a popular programming language like PHP, Python, or JavaScript sure it improves a lot.

Now I suddenly experience faster development speed. This time, I also tried other tools like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library?sort=popular) to set up a local AI runner. I searched for Neovim integrations, I found [codecompanion](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/). It works great! The AI supports me and doesn't interfere when I code. I use `qwen2.5-coder:14b` with Ollama.

Now! I recommend you to try too. Here is something that I recommend you try :

1. Instead of writing your test, especially the one that requires some mock set-up try to use AI instead. It will save you a lot of time. AI will give you some test code and some expectation. I feel like AI is better at writing test, or it just me lazy writing test because it requires some database set-up ha-ha.

2. Use it to learn new tools, now that AI is better at reading code type, I think it resulted in a better understanding of how the library that you are using works! I use it a lot to learn some languages like Swift, PHP, Python, and Rust (Although Rust, seems like it suggests the wrong way that's okay)

3. Use is for mundane tasks, sometimes we programmers (or just me) hate very repetitive tasks like converting some JSON to a language type, and using AI for this is spot on. It is almost 99% correct. Or you can also use it to refactor your else if statements that are too long to begin with.

.... and many more!

That being said, it is not a threat at all for me. I'm not using AI Editor like [Trae](https://www.trae.ai/) yet. But I think it's the same! Now I'm happy to announce that I'm pair programming with AI and shipping 50% faster (because I don't need to create test factories lol).

I hope you, started using it too ~ please don't just take it for granted, always read and try to refactor the code generated from AI. To not be replaced is to have more context than the AI itself. Since we are humans, we know a lot of stuff and understand stuff very - very much than any AI these days.
